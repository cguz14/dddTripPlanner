At Kansas City Taco Company, Arthur Leduc packs all kinds of funky regional and international flavors into tortillas. A local favorite is the Cowboy Burrito, which highlights the classic flavors of Kansas City. To make it, a flour tortilla is packed with pulled pork and hot chorizo and then deep fried. It's then slathered with a gooey, house-made queso blanco and served with rice and spicy pinto beans. “You know what that’s lacking?” Guy asked after a bite. “Nothing!”\n	\n                  520 Walnut St, Kansas City, MO 64106	39.107772	-94.5816238	testrestaurant_state9	testfood_type9	testepisode_info9

Everything on the menu of this taco truck is 100% plant-based. Guy loved the Milanese Torta: Delfin makes his own seitan steak—a plant protein made from wheat gluten—which he then coats in panko and deep fries. The sandwich comes together on torta bread by stacking a layer of black beans, the fried seitan patty, cabbage and fresh tomatoes, and is topped with avocado crema and vegan mayo. Even as a meat lover, Guy was impressed: “You get such great texture in that seitan,” he said.\n	\n                  204 E.

To make the patties, ground beef is blended with cubes of spam, a combination that adds a surprising bit of sweetness to the burger. The mouthwatering patty is topped with house-made pickles and slaw, onion compote and provolone cheese. “People are going to dig it,” Guy said between bites.\n	\n                  5-4280 Kuhio Hwy, Princeville 96722	22.2136004	-159.4749996	testrestaurant_state9	testfood_type9	testepisode_info9

Guy was blown away by the Thai Curry Chicken Sausage Sandwich: the sausage itself is made with a blend of chicken, pork and common ingredients in Thai cooking like cilantro, curry powder, lime juice and coconut milk. The links are served on a bun with a house-made cabbage slaw and a Sriracha mayo. “You’d be hard pressed to tell someone that didn’t come out of a famous Thai restaurant,” Guy said after tasting.\n	\n                  3301 Lancaster Pike, Wilmington, DE 19805	39.753713	-75.5897993	testrestaurant_state9	testfood_type9	testepisode_info9

The burger is made by topping a thick beef patty with three different kinds of pork: sweet bacon jam, hearty thick cut bacon slices and a house-made bacon mayo, which is all topped off with a layer of crunchy tater tots. Guy thought the burger was so amazing, he joked that they should rename the restaurant “The Pig and the Cow” in its honor.\n	\n                  413 N Market St., Wilmington, DE 19801	39.7409441	-75.5512899	testrestaurant_state9	testfood_type9	testepisode_info9

For a lighter option, try the BC Bouillabaisse, a Canadian version of the classic French soup, made with seafood local to the Vancouver area instead of the typical Provencal fish. “It’s so simple, yet so delicious and refined,” Guy said of the soup.\n	\n                  3825 Main St, Vancouver, BC, Canada V5V 3P1	49.2507837	-123.1012792	testrestaurant_state9	testfood_type9	testepisode_info9

The meats are massaged with customized dry rubs laden with secret spices, then marinated overnight and smoked over both oak and pecan woods.

The menu is crowded with dozens of options stuffed with fillings both sweet and savory, but for a taste of an Argentinean classic, Guy recommends the beef gaucho empanada.
