The DDD Trip Planner is a web app with over 1,200 ‚ÄúDiners, Drive-Ins, and Dives‚Äù (DDD) restaurants to get rollin' out to! This app offers a detailed map view all of the DDD restaurants 
from Food Network's 86 page list and makes it easy to plan your next trip. Users can create and edit trips, add and remove stops for the trips, earn badges, and favorite and rate restaurants.

The application is currently running with the use of AWS's Amazon Lightsail and Route 53 at dddtripplanner.com.

## <a name="installation"></a>Setup/Installation ‚å®Ô∏è

#### Requirements:

- Python 3.9.18
- BeautifulSoup
- Google Maps Javascript and Google Geocoding API Keys

To have this app running on your local computer, please follow the below steps:

NOTE: APP IS STILL IN PRODUCTION AND SEED STEPS MAY NOT FUNCTION DEPENDING ON WHICH GIT COMMIT YOU PULL

Clone repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/cguz14/dddTripPlanner.git
```
Create a virtual environment:
```
$ virtualenv env
```
Activate the virtual environment:
```
$ source env/bin/activate
```
Install dependenciesüîó:
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Request Keys for the [Google Maps Javascript](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and [Geocoding](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key) APIs.  
If you're placing IP Address/URL Restrictions on the keys, ensure that you have the Maps key restricted via HTTP and the Geocoding key restricted via IP Address.  
Save them to a file `secrets.sh` (don't commit this file!). Your file should look something like this:
```
export SECRETKEY='abc'
export MAPS_KEY='Mapabc'
export GEO_PLACES_KEY='Geoabc'
```
Source your secrets file:
```
$ source secrets.sh
```

Create database 'dddTripPlanner'.
```
$ createdb dddTripPlanner
```
Create your database tables and seed example data.  
#### Important Note: When all 86 pages are seeded to the database, that will be over 1200 calls to the Geocoding API, be cautious of seeding multiple times.
```
$ python3 model.py
$ python3 seed.py
```
The seed will take a few minutes to complete as it scrapes the page data.

Run the app from the command line.
```
$ python3 server.py
```
