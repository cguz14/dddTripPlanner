Another Canadian classic is the Cod Cakes, which Guy described as “fish and chips gnocchi.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 160 Bay St, Ottawa, CA K1R 7X8                                                                         |          45.4175672 |          -75.7063893 | Ottawa, Canada                       | ChIJsRD4alEEzkwRRMK25vv7_18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info6

Instead of a sweet filling, they stuff the typical puff pastry with a mix of roasted mushrooms and goat cheese before baking. The crispy pastry is then served over a cream made with aquavit, a Scandinavian spirit similar to gin, and is drizzled with a mulled wine sauce.

The standout dish is the whole fried sea bass, which is salt brined for 24 hours before it’s fried to give it a crisp, salty exterior. It’s served with a side of fresh cabbage slaw and a drizzle of chipotle sauce, and is so incredibly simple. “I don’t care if this is the only thing on the menu, I will be back,” Guy said after his first bite.                                                                                                                                                      | 719 Kansas Ave, Kansas City, KS 66105, USA                                                             |   39.08731179999999 |   -94.62691679999999 | Kansas City, KS                      | ChIJwfzOtJXxwIcR2DgUmUZnKLk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info8

In addition to traditional barbecue cuts like brisket, they’re making serious sausages they call the Texas Hot Gut. Beef and pork are ground together with a house-made spice paste before being piped into natural casings. The links are then cold smoked for four hours to give them the perfect texture. “No dainty little sausage here, that’s meaty,” Guy said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 320 N Zaragoza Rd #105, El Paso, TX 79907, USA                                                         |          31.6994041 |         -106.3237866 | El Paso, TX                          | Ei4zMjAgTiBaYXJhZ296YSBSZCAjMTA1LCBFbCBQYXNvLCBUWCA3OTkwNywgVVNBIh8aHQoWChQKEglheS_x30LnhhH9qTfuFmLushIDMTA1                                                                                                                                                    | test_episode_info8

Nearly everything at the restaurant is sourced locally, from the potatoes in their Bison Fries to the meat in their Lamb Sandwich. To make the sandwich, homemade bread is spread with house-made tomato aioli and olive tapenade and is topped with feta, mozzarella, roasted red peppers and tender braised lamb.

Guy loved the Milanese Torta: Delfin makes his own seitan steak—a plant protein made from wheat gluten—which he then coats in panko and deep fries. The sandwich comes together on torta bread by stacking a layer of black beans, the fried seitan patty, cabbage and fresh tomatoes, and is topped with avocado crema and vegan mayo. Even as a meat lover, Guy was impressed: “You get such great texture in that seitan,” he said.                                                                                                                                          | 204 E Rio Grande Ave, El Paso, TX 79902, USA                                                           |          31.7646952 |         -106.4919182 | El Paso, TX                          | ChIJ5aROFP9Y54YRSmPPmGX0k-s                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info9

At Kansas City Taco Company, Arthur Leduc packs all kinds of funky regional and international flavors into tortillas. A local favorite is the Cowboy Burrito, which highlights the classic flavors of Kansas City. To make it, a flour tortilla is packed with pulled pork and hot chorizo and then deep fried. It's then slathered with a gooey, house-made queso blanco and served with rice and spicy pinto beans. “You know what that’s lacking?” Guy asked after a bite. “Nothing!”                                                                                                                                                                                | 520 Walnut St, Kansas City, MO 64106, USA                                                              |           39.107772 |          -94.5816238 | Kansas City, MO                      | ChIJcXQv6orwwIcR8FpvT7aJ52I                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info9

Her kabobs are made on a special machine dedicated to shaping spiced meats. “The machine is scary, but it makes a bomb kabob,” Guy said. Don't miss the Beef Koobideh: seasoned beef kabobs served with crispy Persian rice (called tadig) and a shallot-yogurt sauce.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 110 N Mesa St d, El Paso, TX 79901, USA                                                                |          31.7583624 |         -106.4867517 | El Paso, TX                          | EicxMTAgTiBNZXNhIFN0IGQsIEVsIFBhc28sIFRYIDc5OTAxLCBVU0EiNxo1CjASLgoUChIJy7pxiAJZ54YRrgi90TgCN5EQbioUChIJCboAtgBY54YR17586FCJ0dMSAWQ                                                                                                                             | test_episode_info9

While the atmosphere is 100% fun, they’re serious about cooking interesting dishes like their signature Iniki Burger. To make the patties, ground beef is blended with cubes of spam, a combination that adds a surprising bit of sweetness to the burger.

For a lighter option, try the BC Bouillabaisse, a Canadian version of the classic French soup, made with seafood local to the Vancouver area instead of the typical Provencal fish. “It’s so simple, yet so delicious and refined,” Guy said of the soup.                                                                                                                                                           | 3825 Main St, Vancouver, BC, Canada V5V 3P1                                                            |          49.2507837 |         -123.1012792 | Vancouver, Canada                    | ChIJcbbrFvpzhlQRKfORESoNRY0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info9

After moving to Chico, California from San Francisco 20 years ago, owner and chef Darren Chadderdon realized he missed the diverse Asian flavors available in the big city. He decided to take things into his own hands, and traveled to Thailand to take cooking classes before returning home to open his own restaurant.

The white pizza features a layer of provolone and mozzarella cheeses studded with chopped garlic, mounds of baked ricotta cheese and heaps of blanched spinach. “It tastes like the most amazing sauteed spinach you’ve ever had in your life,” Love says.                               | 1415 S Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78704, USA                                                             |          30.2492231 |          -97.7495174 | Austin, TX                           | ChIJ510zUfy0RIYRZ31felkrjJk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info19

The barbecue served here indeed has its roots in the Lone Star State, as owner Kevin Bludso learned how to smoke meats from his Texan grandmother. The crowds pack in for the ‘cue, which includes succulent pork ribs and chickens. The meats are massaged with customized dry rubs laden with secret spices, then marinated overnight and smoked over both oak and pecan woods. For meat lovers with massive appetites, Madison recommends The Lunch Tray. This option features a selection of smoky meats and satisfying sides, including brisket, pulled pork, Texas hot links, collard greens, mac and cheese, corn bread and more. | 609 N La Brea Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90036, USA                                                          |          34.0822537 |         -118.3443913 | Los Angeles, CA                      | ChIJUQIiFNW4woARnJ2-FcXEVBQ                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info19

Henry marinates the goat with a heat-packed blend of housemade wet jerk and Madras curry powder, then cooks the meat in a seasoned curry sauce studded with carrots, onions and potatoes.

The menu is crowded with dozens of options stuffed with fillings both sweet and savory, but for a taste of an Argentinean classic, Guy recommends the beef gaucho empanada.

Also try the crisp, golden fries that come heaped with two Korean classics: bulgogi and kimchi.                                                                                                                                                                                    | 3422 Farm to Market 2920 #220, Spring, TX 77388, USA                                                   |          30.0709919 |          -95.4716122 | Spring, TX                           | ChIJ62xb2Zg0R4YRZoHDGEbMp78                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info20

The “wild waffle sandwiches,” as Guy called them, are a particular standout. Listed as Waffle-Wiches on the menu, these golden, fluffy creations come stuffed with a delectable array of fillings. Guy opted for a sweet variation inspired by s’mores. Two Belgian waffles made from a meringue-laced batter are sandwiched with graham cracker crumbs, chocolate sauce and a massive housemade marshmallow that’s caramelized with a torch before serving.                                                                                                                                                       | 3306 N Davidson St, Charlotte, NC 28205, USA                                                           |          35.2477999 |          -80.8040509 | Charlotte, NC                        | ChIJGZogG9ofVIgRFjouGYdnv-g                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info20

The towering Trash Can Nachos are a menu mainstay. Layer upon layer of crisp tortilla chips are smothered in a silky cheese sauce and black beans, then heaped with cheddar cheese and smoky, succulent pulled pork.

A reservation is needed to get into this casual joint that Guy said is the place to go “if you’re looking for an adventure and want to try eclectic food.” The menu rotates semi-regularly, but one standout that had Guy raving is the pork belly burger. A pork-and-beef patty comes smothered in cheese and piled high with toppings that include caramelized onions, pork belly and bacon. Another must-try is the Tartar de Kamajiis , which sings with bright flavors, thanks to a mixture of fresh tuna, ginger, hot pepper and tomato.                | Av Palenque 10, SM 62, MZ 5, Cancun, MX 77500                                                          |          21.1642867 |   -86.83880140000001 | Cancún, Mexico                       | Ei1QYWxlbnF1ZSAxMC1NWiA1LCA3NzUwOSBDYW5jw7puLCBRLlIuLCBNZXhpY28iOho4CjASLgoUChIJuZM_mAssTI8RNyvyPBqnY38QCioUChIJbVYGDgosTI8RXEclliY-JrMSBE1aIDU                                                                                                                 | test_episode_info20

You can also get your seafood in sandwich form, as po’ boys dominate the menu.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 603 N Washington Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55401, USA                                                       |          44.9867713 |   -93.27638379999999 | Minneapolis, MN                      | ChIJyWXNQ4kys1IRHjGkTKiQVGE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info22

A real stunner is the pulpo carpaccio, made from delicate slices of tender octopus that come adorned with a dazzling array of toppings that include sun-dried tomatoes, Parmigiano Reggiano, toasted pine nuts and olive oil caviar. “It’s a whole symphony of flavors,” Guy declared after taking a bite.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 1818 NW 23rd Pl, Portland, OR 97210, USA                                                               |          45.5357177 |          -122.699664 | Portland, OR                         | ChIJawRK0-UJlVQRxnrACDwY3ac                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info22

While Anderson’s California sensibility translates as a preference for fresh produce, Midwesterner Davis favors comfort food classics. He steps up housemade buttermilk biscuits by smothering them in a tomato gravy made from his grandmother’s Appalachian recipe. Crushed tomatoes are brought together with evaporated milk, whole milk and flour to make a velvety gravy that Guy called “top-notch.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 1301 NE Dekum St, Portland, OR 97211, USA                                                              |          45.5719918 |         -122.6516058 | Portland, OR                         | ChIJhZqZBfymlVQRd0nWHnnvs8g                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info22

Chef-Owner David Vargas channels the traditional tastes of Mexico, but delivers them in slightly tweaked formats. His pork belly tacos are a popular pick. Housemade tortillas are layered with jicama slaw and crisp slabs of spice-laden pork belly, then topped with mango salsa, Cotija cheese and a flurry of fresh flower petals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 2456 Lafayette Rd, Portsmouth, NH 03801, USA                                                           |   43.03367919999999 |          -70.7848187 | Portsmouth, NH                       | ChIJPZCLUUbA4okRsnIiwET2QkY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info22

Guy raves about the Vietnamese Crepe: a crunchy shell stuffed with a coconut milk-laced mixture of shrimp and pork.

For instance, he takes that New Jersey comfort food staple known as disco fries and amps it up with the addition of pork belly. The meat is seasoned and cubed, then layered on a thatch of housemade fries, along with a heap of banana peppers, a melty blanket of fontina cheese, a flurry of scallions and a drizzle of malt vinaigrette that Guy says “turbocharges the dish.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 137 Washington St, Rocky Hill, NJ 08553, USA                                                           |          40.3997905 |   -74.63459929999999 | Rocky Hill, NJ                       | ChIJ805JG9Lnw4kRQGo8zsS_D9k                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info22

He sources many of his ingredients straight from the adjacent butcher shop, which features a dizzying array of housemade sausages, marinated meats and more. Standout menu items include the Chili & Cheese Corn Holes. For this dish, Chef Marcotte reinterprets classic corn dogs as bite-size spheres of house-ground meat doused with spices, studded with melty cheese and covered in a golden crust.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 58 NH-27, Raymond, NH 03077, USA                                                                       |          43.0391544 |   -71.16457869999999 | Raymond, NH                          | ChIJU3waum324okRQYikdw8eI70                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info22

The Mile High Meatloaf, for instance, features grass-fed beef from a nearby farm. Hefty slabs of beautifully caramelized meatloaf are layered with mashed potatoes, then doused with a gravy made with mirepoix, veal bone stock and prime rib. “This is tender; this is juicy,” Guy said of the dish. “Look at me — I can’t stop eating it.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 2357 US-206, Southampton Township, NJ 08088, USA                                                       |          39.9709141 |          -74.7358558 | Southampton Township, NJ             | ChIJNQhtpadHwYkRSqzeyeGcuMk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info22

So Guy was surprised to discover St. Louis-style spare ribs, which are The Kitchen's sleeper hit. The pork is soaked in a red wine vinegar brine studded with star anise, juniper berries and red pepper flakes, then hit with a smoked paprika rub. The ribs are grilled until beautifully caramelized and come drenched in an agrodolce sauce that adds both sweetness and spice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 171 Islington St, Portsmouth, NH 03801, USA                                                            |          43.0743906 |          -70.7640782 | Portsmouth, NH                       | ChIJoznyWXW_4okRgTMwUztxslU                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info22

This meaty pie is slathered with housemade sauce, then topped with a mix of mozzarella and provolone cheeses, a flurry of banana peppers, and meaty ribbons of soppressata and hearty housemade sausage, which makes for a well-balanced pizza that Guy declared “dynamite.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 5416 Penn Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55410, USA                                                            |          44.9045443 |   -93.30897279999999 | Minneapolis, MN                      | ChIJN-so4e8m9ocR_E9CPt0VhNA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info23

Inside you'll find bright sushi rolls made from fish so fresh it's pulled straight from owner Shawn Steadman's boat (affectionately named the Shiso Phat). "It's so fresh it's almost jumping into my mouth," Guy said of the TNT, a shrimp tempura roll topped with ahi poke.

Back in the 1940s, Barone's owners set out to re-create the Italian-style pizza popular in New York using the only tool available — a sheet pan — and thus the signature slices were born. Another must-try is the ricotta and Parmesan lasagna, served with meatballs and housemade marinara sauce.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 13726 Oxnard St, Valley Glen, CA 91401, USA                                                            |          34.1791691 |         -118.4321452 | Los Angeles, CA                      | ChIJczJGNFGWwoARpoS4QHfu1t8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info23

Pork lovers, opt for the Gramercy. In addition to featuring red sauce and melted mozzarella, this pork-centric pie comes loaded with pepperoni, sausage, bacon, soppressata and guanciale.

They actually paved the way for small-production brewers to sell beer onsite, which was illegal in Minnesota before 2011. Once the “Surly bill” became law, Ansari and his team built a 50,000-square-foot hall where visitors can indulge in a cold one paired with classic comfort foods, including the Pulled Pork Platter.

Guy was won over by the Pastelon de Carne, a hearty dish that locals liken to lasagna. Ground beef is seasoned with adobo, then studded with olives and layered over a base of sweet plantains. And don’t sleep on the bistec sandwich that comes stuffed with melty Swiss cheese, tender sirloin, grilled onions and avocado slices. “That’s like [a] Puerto Rican-Cuban-Philly cheesesteak,” Guy declared.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 901 Lincoln Ave, San Rafael, CA 94901, USA                                                             |          37.9717984 |          -122.524245 | San Rafael, CA                       | ChIJOXUhFveZhYARgGEouzyDvMc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info54

Guy was left impressed by menu items such as duck confit spring rolls and pulled pork empanadas. “That is an orchestra right there; that’s a medley of just great flavor,” Guy said of the empanadas. They start with fresh ham, which is cooked down with a mix of chili powders and spices, then shredded and layered with sweet potatoes; they're finished in a fried dough pocket slicked with a chipotle-honey glaze.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 435 Spring Garden St, Philadelphia, PA 19123, USA                                                      |          39.9613285 |          -75.1460283 | Philadelphia, PA                     | ChIJ58Y1Y3zIxokRg9Rhww6-HdI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info54

The Totem Pole is a towering dish of crab stuffing, crispy soft-shell crab, fried eggplant and a shrimp kabab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 279 Hickory Ave, Harahan, LA 70123, USA                                                                |          29.9409231 |          -90.1945523 | Harahan, LA                          | ChIJ3x9l8lq6IIYR_5148a-plCA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info84

A favorite is the Flame Thrower panini which is a mixture of house-made roast beef and pulled pork spiced up with pepper jack cheese, house-made habanero salsa and jalapenos. On Saturdays only they serve authentic barbecue smoked on site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 68703 Perez Rd, Cathedral City, CA 92234, USA                                                          |          33.7836307 |         -116.4637394 | Cathedral City, CA                   | ChIJn0wentcC24AR2eV6ldkYkoc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info85
