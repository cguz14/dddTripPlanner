Guy loved the Milanese Torta: Delfin makes his own seitan steak‚Äîa plant protein made from wheat gluten‚Äîwhich he then coats in panko and deep fries. The sandwich comes together on torta bread by stacking a layer of black beans, the fried seitan patty, cabbage and fresh tomatoes, and is topped with avocado crema and vegan mayo.

For meat lovers with massive appetites, Madison recommends The Lunch Tray.

Fresh catches are the specialty here, such as a hogfish that‚Äôs prepared in a style known as tikin xic. Served whole, the fish is rubbed with a distinctive red paste made from achiato seeds, layered with tomatoes, onions and peppers, then grilled until lightly charred. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs dynamite,‚Äù Guy declared.

The menu has expanded with the space, as the Smack Shack now offers a slew of seafood favorites (and fun cocktails) in addition to the fresh lobster rolls that started it all. There are options aplenty, including fish boils and lobster-studded mac and cheese (which was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives). You can also get your seafood in sandwich form, as po‚Äô boys dominate the menu.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 603 N Washington Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55401, USA                                                       |          44.9867713 |   -93.27638379999999 | Minneapolis, MN                      | ChIJyWXNQ4kys1IRHjGkTKiQVGE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info22

Chef and owner Jason Seither grew up on the Bayou boiling crawfish with his dad and cooking with his mom. He takes the best local, old school ingredients and adds his own wild style to his dishes. The Volcano is like an upside-down Asian-style taco salad with fresh ahi, crab salad and shrimp. The Totem Pole is a towering dish of crab stuffing, crispy soft-shell crab, fried eggplant and a shrimp kabab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 279 Hickory Ave, Harahan, LA 70123, USA                                                                |          29.9409231 |          -90.1945523 | Harahan, LA                          | ChIJ3x9l8lq6IIYR_5148a-plCA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | test_episode_info84

A favorite is the Flame Thrower panini which is a mixture of house-made roast beef and pulled pork spiced up with pepper jack cheese, house-made habanero salsa and jalapenos.
